# Acme-Bank

## Purpose and method

This project was designed to introduce defensive JavaScript development. I was supplied with a working app for a small credit union and had to fix its vulnerabilities. Cyber security is a growing concern in the technology sector and learning how fix vulnerabilities felt like a crucial skill.The bulk of the code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) with instructions on how to set up the project. This project helped me to understand how to reduce the risk of cyber attacks such as XSS, CSRF and SQL injections while developing.
